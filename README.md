# General-Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems

This is a playground for experiments preceding my contribution to Mathlib.

My long-term goal is to formalize the dichotomy for fixed-template finite-valued constraint satisfaction problems by Thapper, Živný, and Kolmogorov while exploring potential generalizations (costs in restricted monoids instead of restricted semirings (rationals), infinite domains, partially ordered codomains, ...).
